CHILDREN'S HOPE FOUNDATION — BACKEND REQUIREMENTS AUDIT
==============================================================================
Date: February 17, 2026
Audited Files: index.html, donate.html, thank_you.html, home.js, donate.js,
               thank_you.js, common.css, home.css, donate.css, thank_you.css,
               sitemap.xml, robots.txt

This document lists every area of the site that currently has NO backend
support and needs server-side work to become a fully functional website.


==============================================================================
1. DONATION PROCESSING & DATA COLLECTION (CRITICAL)
==============================================================================
File: donate.js (lines 100-114), donate.html
Current behaviour:
  - User picks an amount and clicks "I've Made the Transfer"
  - The data is saved to localStorage and the user is redirected to
    thank_you.html. No data is sent anywhere.
  - The bank account number (1234567890) is a placeholder.
  - The donation form collects ONLY: amount and goal, not the donor email.

What needs to be built:
  [x] A real bank account number
  [ ] Add an input field for the donor's email address on the donation form
  [ ] A simple backend API endpoint (e.g. POST /api/donations) to receive
      the amount, goal, timestamp, and the donor's email address.
  [ ] Store the records in a simple database (like SQLite)
==============================================================================
Current behaviour:
  - The site is a collection of static HTML, CSS, and JS files
  - sitemap.xml references https://www.childrenshopefoundation.org/ but
    the site is not deployed anywhere
  - robots.txt is set up correctly

What needs to be built:
  [ ] Choose a hosting platform:
        - Static-only (no backend): Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, Cloudflare
          Pages — quickest to deploy but won't support backend features
        - With backend: Render, Railway, DigitalOcean, AWS, Heroku
  [ ] Set up the domain: childrenshopefoundation.org (or similar)
  [ ] SSL certificate (HTTPS) — most hosts provide this free
  [ ] Set up DNS records
  [ ] Configure proper caching headers for CSS/JS files
  [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automatic deployment on push


==============================================================================
==============================================================================
3. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
==============================================================================
Current behaviour:
  - No server-side code exists, so there's nothing to exploit yet — but once
    a backend is added, these must be addressed.

What needs to be built:
  [ ] CSRF protection on all forms (donation, newsletter)
  [ ] Rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent spam/abuse
  [ ] Input sanitization (prevent XSS and SQL injection)
  [ ] HTTPS enforcement (redirect HTTP to HTTPS)
  [ ] Secure storage of any sensitive data (donor info, admin passwords)
  [ ] CORS configuration for API endpoints
  [ ] Environment variables for secrets (API keys, DB credentials)
  [ ] Regular security updates for dependencies



RECOMMENDED IMPLEMENTATION ORDER
==============================================================================

1. Set up a simple backend framework (Node.js/Express) and SQLite database.
2. Build connection to frontend newsletter form to collect subscriber emails.
3. Update donation form to collect donor email and send data to DB.
4. Add og:image properties to improve social links.

==============================================================================
TECHNOLOGY RECOMMENDATIONS (COMPLETELY FREE)
==============================================================================
Backend:       Node.js + Express (Open source, free)
Database:      SQLite (Built-in file, 100% free forever)
Hosting:       Glitch, Render (Free Tier), or Fly.io (Free Tier)
Domain:        Use the free subdomain provided by the host
